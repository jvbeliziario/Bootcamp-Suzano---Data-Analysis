# Data Analysis and Power BI - Project 3 -- Financial Report

Power BI dashboard providing an analysis of sales and profit by country, product, and segment. This interactive report leverages the dataset included in the project to uncover valuable insights, such as regional trends, product performance, and customer segment profitability.

As following part of the third project for the DIO bootcamp, focused on visual resources in Power BI, I developed a more comprehensive and deeper report using Power BI for the Financial Sample Project, which is the detailed version of the Financial Report.
