# Creating a Star Schema Model

This project challenge aimed to develop skills in creating Star Schema models, which are essential for enhancing performance in Power BI. Power BI delivers optimized performance when working with data structured in this format. To build the Star Schema model, a relational database model was provided as a reference to guide the necessary adjustments for the final structure.

# Relational Model

The relational data model is widely used today and is one of the most popular among various existing models. It provides an intuitive and straightforward way to represent data in tables. In a relational model, each row in a table is a record with a unique ID (Primary Key). The tables consist of columns that store the attributes of the persisted data. The relational model is employed by organizations of various sizes and sectors, serving a wide range of applications, from managing daily sales in large retail networks to overseeing operational production processes. Relational databases are ideal for scenarios where data needs to be related and managed securely and consistently, based on defined rules.
